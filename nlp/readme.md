This folder contains data and information related to Natural Language Processing (NLP). All materials here were collected, created, or reviewed as part of the Natural Language Processing course at the Universidade de Brasília (UnB). The folders are organized by chapter and assignment to support skill development in NLP for the course.

The primary text is Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft) (available [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)). Folders are structured to align with the book’s table of contents; for example, the folder <code>I.2-tokenizer</code> corresponds to part one (section <code>I</code>), chapter two (section <code>2</code>), and the assignment description <code>tokenizer</code>.

The <code>util</code> folder contains utility functions used across multiple assignments. The primary purpose of creating a function here is to enable its reuse in different contexts.
